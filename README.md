# <first-job-edit>

## Description


I was really motivated to finish this project because I thought of it as a first job assignment. I wanted to do really well on this project as if was assigned by an employer on a real job. I built this project because I want to improve my feature reqest skills and better able to make good code better. I was able to add sematic elements and alt attributes to the HTML file to make it an easier to read code and a text just in case the image could not display on certain devices version. I also cleaned up the CSS file by taking the over written code and putting them in the right section while keeping the elements in order. This project help me learn about sematic elements, alt attributes, how to not over write code, how to keep everthing in order throughout the code.
